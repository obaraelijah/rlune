///
/// Modules are initialized in three steps.
/// If any module returns an error in any of those steps,
/// the entire application will be prevented from starting.
///
/// ## pre init
///
/// Every modules' `pre_init` function is run concurrently.
///
/// In this step a module may not interact with any other module
/// but is free to load configuration or other data
/// entirely managed by the module itself.
///
/// The `pre_init` function may return data (`Self::PreInit`)
/// which is then passed to the actual `init` function.
///
/// ## init
///
/// Every modules' `init` function is run sequentially in the order defined by the application author.
///
/// This step should perform the module's main initialization
/// and returns the module singleton which is stored in globally.
///
/// TODO: dependencies
///
/// ## post init
///
/// Every modules' `post_init` function is run concurrently.
///
/// At this point every module has been initialized and is available globally.
///
/// Modules which others depend on have been made aware of their dependents and may run some finishing initialization code.
